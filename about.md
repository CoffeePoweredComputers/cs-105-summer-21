## Course Elements

### zyBooks and Post-Reading

This course will have two zyBooks and post reading activities due per week.
The zyBook activities include reading section of the textbook and completing the interactive activites along the way. 
Post-readings activites are on PrairieLearn and are our attempt to solicit information on what aspect of the readings were confusing and which topics were of interest to you.
Please respond to these questions thoughtfully and with as much detail as possiable as they help us construct the lectures.
They will be due every Thursday and Sunday night at <b><u>11:00 PM CST</u></b>.

### Homework

There are two homeworks assigned every week (one after every lecture) and are due Thursday and Sunday night at <b><u>11:00 PM CST</u></b> respectivly. 
Homework activities can be found the the courses's PrairieLearn.
 
### Lecture

Lectures will meet on Zoom twice a week and be accompanied by Discord text chat rooms where you can collaborate with your peers for the included lecture questions.
The structure of the lectures will be as follows:
* Lecture 1 - Weekly announcements, Lecture questions on last weeks muddiest and last topic, Mini-Lecture on new topic
* Lecture 2 - Reminders, Lecture questions on Last Topic, Mini-Lecture on new topic

### Labs

Labs will meet using Discord.  
Labs will be focused on giving students practice with the course content and debugging code.  Labs are designed to be completed by a group of students. 
Lab attendance and completion will contribute to your grade - however, lab completion is largely based on effort put in and ability to demonstrate to a course TA or CA the work that has been done on the lab rather than a set "correctness" standard.

Follow these steps to get Discord setup and running on your computers:
1. Make an account with your Illinois outlook account: [discord.com](https://discord.com)
2. Download the desktop applications from the website and login: [discord.com/download](https://discord.com/download)
3. Join the lab server via the following invite link: []()

Once you have logged onto the server please navigate to the #announcements channel.

Once in the channel, you will see a message from the Discord bot (Marvin) asking you to "react" to its message with the letter icon.
Simply click in the box picured below that matches with your lab section.
Once you have done this, the bot will automatically add a role to yoru user profile giving you accessto your section's lab channel. 
This should appear on the left-hand side under the category "Lab Channels" as pictured below.

You can always come back to Marvin’s message and select a different lab section by:
1. Clicking your previous lab section’s associated emoji.
2. Clicking on the icon associated with the lab section you wish to attend.
This will remove access to your previous lab section and give you access to the new one you desire to attend. 
If you ever choose to temporarily attend another lab section please be sure to make a private post on CampusWire or contact the TA in charge of the lab section you wish to attend prior to switching lab sections on Discord.
