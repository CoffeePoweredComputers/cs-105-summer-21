navtitle: Week 2 Updates
---

Hello Everyone!

Here are just a few reminders and updates for this week:

1. Homework 2 has been posted and is due 11:00PM (CST) this Friday. It covers topics two and three and is divided into two sections of questions so please get started on it as early as possible. Additionally, please note that each section of the homework has a maximum number of points you can earn within it that will contribute to your final score. This will be clarified in today's lecture.
2. The zyBooks topic 3 participation activities and its associated post reading are due tomorrow night at 11:00PM (CST). Please be sure you are filling in and submitting answers to both questions when completing the post readings.
3. The first quiz for the course will be this Thursday so, if you have not already done so, please use the CBTF scheduler to register for the quiz. A practice quiz has also been posted to PrairieLearn which roughly approximates the size and content of the actual quiz.

All the best,
David
