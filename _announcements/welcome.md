Hello all and welcome to CS 105!


This course will be all online and with synchronous lectures, labs, and quizzes. In preparation for the first week of class please refer to the following list of instructions:


1. For lab sections and lecture discussions we will be using Discord. Please follow the download and setup instructions on Discord's website then use the following invite links to join the lecture (https://discord.gg/7ukx3kyF) and lab (https://discord.gg/JHGYjn52) servers.
2. You should purchase the book as soon as possible via the instructions on the course site's about page. There is already a chapter reading assignment up and the first post reading activity will be posted tonight so I strongly encourage you to begin these activities immediately in preparation for the first day of class. The due dates for these assignments and all other activities can be found in the course calendar, here.
3. The course will be using CampusWire for all Q&A related to the class. You should have been sent an invite earlier to the site today but, if you can't find it or have trouble accessing CampusWire please email David Smith (dhsmith2@illinois.edu). Further information on how CampusWire and help-seeking in general, refer to the getting help section of the course website.
4. The bulk of the coursework will be done on PrairieLearn. To add the course, follow these instructions:
	* Navigate to PrarieLearn’s website
	* Click on the “Enroll course” button
	* Search for “CS 105”
	* Add the instance of CS 105 for Summer 2021


I encourage you all to take some time to look over the course website to get a sense of what we will be covering. However please note that nothing on the site is considered finalized until Monday and may change over the next few days. We will be going over the course structure and expectations more in-depth during the first lecture. For now, simply focus on completing the first reading activity, which is already on zyBooks and is due on June 15th.


Please let me know if you have any questions and I look forward to seeing you all in lecture on Monday!
